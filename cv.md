#### About Myself:
I believe that IT is the future and it is very interesting for me to develop in this direction. Having studied various IT specialties: what the job consists of, what skills and personal qualities will be useful in a particular area, I chose the specialty of a Front-end developer and strive to develop in this direction. I love solving programming problems, cats and good coffee. I want to gain knowledge and skills that will be enough for employment in the company. I am an idea person, very proactive, quite flexible, mobile and creative. And thanks to the experience of working as a chief accountant in a consulting company, I can find a way out of any situation without stress.
